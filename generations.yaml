    description: "The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid (technically a plug-in hybrid despite the simplified naming) was the first electrified minivan in the American market. Based on the standard Pacifica, it combines a modified version of the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine with a dual-motor eFlite electrically variable transmission and a 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack mounted under the floor. This system delivers a combined 260 HP and an all-electric range of approximately 32-33 miles before the gasoline engine engages, with a total range of over 500 miles. The battery can be fully charged in approximately 2 hours using a 240-volt Level 2 charger or about 14 hours with a standard household outlet. Unlike the regular Pacifica, the Hybrid model doesn't offer Stow 'n Go second-row seats (as the battery occupies that underfloor space), though it maintains the fold-flat third row. Interior appointments and available technology closely match the conventional Pacifica, including the Uconnect Theater rear entertainment system and advanced safety features. A significant update in 2021 aligned with the standard Pacifica's refresh, adding the new Uconnect 5 infotainment system with a 10.1-inch touchscreen, refreshed exterior styling, and available all-wheel drive on the non-hybrid model (the hybrid remains front-wheel drive only). The Pacifica Hybrid qualifies for federal tax incentives and various state rebates, making it an attractive option for environmentally conscious families seeking minivan practicality with significantly improved fuel efficiency. Its EPA-estimated 82 MPGe in combined electric/gasoline operation represents exceptional efficiency for a seven-passenger vehicle."
